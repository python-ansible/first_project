A political crisis began to unfold in Zimbabwe on Wednesday. The military took control of the country and detained President Robert Mugabe. It insisted that it was "not a military takeover" and that Mugabe and his family were safe. According to BBC, the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) Party announced on its Twitter account that the country had just experienced "a bloodless peaceful transition" and former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa will take control of the party, with Mugabe being removed as president. But a few hours later, it was pointed out that the account was not an official one. The BBC apologized for describing it as "official."

93-year-old Mugabe has been Zimbabwe's president since 1987. He is viewed as a national hero who fought against white-minority rule. Later he became an adversary of the Western world after he launched land reforms by taking over white-owned farms in order to resettle landless blacks.

Although isolated by the West, Zimbabwe has played an active role in African integration. After a short period of rapid economic development, the country has been in an economic slump. Yet Mugabe has retained power and is considered a classic "strong man."
